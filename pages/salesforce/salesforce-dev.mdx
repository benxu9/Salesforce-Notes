# Notes For PD1 Trailhead

## Apex and .Net Basics module

- There are primitive types, such as Integer, Double, Long, Date, Datetime, String, and Boolean. There is also an ID data type that is used for any valid 18-character Lightning Platform record identifier assigned by the system.
- In Apex all variables are initialized to null by default
- Apex strings are always treated as a primitive value type.
- sObject is just a Salesforce object. You can think of it as a table in a database. The sObject can be either a standard one that comes built in with Salesforce or a custom one that you define yourself.

#### List Examples

```
List<String> myStrings =  new List<String>();
String[] myStrings = new List<String>();
List<String> myStrings =  new List<String> {'String1', 'String2', 'String3' };
```

#### Set Examples

A set is commonly used to store ID values because the value are always unique.

```
Set<ID> accountIds = new
  Set<ID>{'001d000000BOaHSAA1','001d000000BOaHTAA1'};
List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Name
  FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds];
```

#### Maps

```
Map<Id, Account> accountMap = new Map<Id, Account>([SELECT Id, Name FROM Account]);
```

#### Visual Force

- Visualforce is a framework for rendering HTML pages using an MVC paradigm.

#### Additional Notes

- Apex and Database are Tightly Coupled
- Each standard or custom object in the database has a "mystical" representation via an Apex class
- The class and its underlying object are essentially a mirror image of one another that is constantly in sync.
- The platform works hard to ensure these dependencies and won't let the database schema and your code become
  out of sync. Therefore, if you attempt to delete a custom object or a field that is referenced by Apex code, the platform will raise an error and disallow the action.
- You must have 75% test coverage to deploy your Apex code to a production org.

## Execution Context

Method of Invoking Apex

| Method                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database Trigger               | Invoked for a specific event on a custom or standard object.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Anonymous Apex                 | Code snippets executed on the fly in Dev Console & other tools.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Asynchronous Apex              | Occurs when executing a future or queueable Apex, running a batch job, or scheduling Apex to run at a specified interval.                                                                                                       |
| Web Services                   | Code that is exposed via SOAP or REST web services.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Email Services                 | Code that is set up to process inbound email.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Visualforce or Lightning Pages | Visualforce controllers and Lightning components can execute Apex code automatically or when a user initiates an action, such as clicking a button. Lightning components can also be executed by Lightning processes and flows. |

Besides invoking Apex code, actions, such as creating a new task, sending an email, performing a field update, or sending an outbound message, can all be triggered by one of the declarative platform features. These actions also run within an execution context.

By default, Apex executes in system context. Apex code has access to all objects and fields. Object permissions, field-level security, and sharing rules arenâ€™t applied for the current user. You can use the with sharing keyword to specify that the sharing rules for the current user be taken into account for a class.

## Trigger Essentials

Similar to triggers in SQL Server, Apex database triggers execute programming logic before or after events to records in Salesforce.

When defining the trigger, you can specify more than one of the following events:

- before insert
- before update
- before delete
- after insert
- after update
- after delete
- after undelete

```
trigger TriggerName on ObjectName (trigger_events) {
   // code_block
}
```

**You only want to resort to using a trigger when you are absolutely sure that the same thing cannot be accomplished with one of our point-and-click automation tools.**

It's considered a best practice to use only one trigger per object, which you see in the following example. You can then use context-specific handler methods within triggers to create logic-less triggers. By adopting this practice, you can avoid the common pitfalls that new developers fall into.

## Working with Limits

The two limits you will probably be the most concerned with involve the number of **SOQL queries** or **DML statements**.

## Record-Triggered flows

Trigger = What Launched the flow
Criteria = What conditions for the flow to launch (like a filter)
Action = what the flow does

### record trigger flow options

- FastField Update = before save updates
- Related Records and actions = during and after saved
  - crud records, subflows, actions, emails, post to chatter
- Run Asynchronously = Immediately after the record update that triggered the flow is complete. Benefit: Avoids slowing down or blocking the record update that triggered the flow
- Scheduled path = n the future, after the trigger has fired, based on dates and times. Followup reminder 2 months from now

### Flow trigger explorer and Time-Based Workflow

- use Flow trigger explorer to see types of flows, re-order flows, activate and deactivate
- check for scehduled path flows in Time-based workflow setup page

## Apex Basics & Databases

### SOSL

Salesforce Object Search Language (SOSL) is a Salesforce search language that is used to perform text
searches in records. Use SOSL to search fields across multiple standard and custom object records in Salesforce. SOSL is similar to Apache Lucene.

```
String soslFindClause = 'Wingo OR SFDC';
List<List<sObject>> searchList = [FIND :soslFindClause IN ALL FIELDS
                    RETURNING Account(Name),Contact(FirstName,LastName,Department)];
Account[] searchAccounts = (Account[])searchList[0];
Contact[] searchContacts = (Contact[])searchList[1];
```

You can filter SOSL results by adding conditions in the WHERE clause for an object. For example, this results in only accounts whose industry is Apparel to be returned: RETURNING Account(Name, Industry WHERE Industry='Apparel').

Likewise, ordering results for one sObject is supported by adding ORDER BY for an object. For example this causes the returned accounts to be ordered by the Name field: RETURNING Account(Name, Industry ORDER BY Name).

The number of returned records can be limited to a subset of records. This example limits the returned accounts to 10 only: RETURNING Account(Name, Industry LIMIT 10).

### triggers

```
trigger AddRelatedRecord on Account(after insert, after update) {
    List<Opportunity> oppList = new List<Opportunity>();
    // Add an opportunity for each account if it doesn't already have one.
    // Iterate over accounts that are in this trigger but that don't have opportunities.
    List<Account> toProcess = null;
    switch on Trigger.operationType {
        when AFTER_INSERT {
        // All inserted Accounts will need the Opportunity, so there is no need to perform the query
            toProcess = Trigger.New;
        }
        when AFTER_UPDATE {
            toProcess = [SELECT Id,Name FROM Account
                         WHERE Id IN :Trigger.New AND
                         Id NOT IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity WHERE AccountId in :Trigger.New)];
        }
    }
    for (Account a : toProcess) {
        // Add a default opportunity for this account
        oppList.add(new Opportunity(Name=a.Name + ' Opportunity',
                                    StageName='Prospecting',
                                    CloseDate=System.today().addMonths(1),
                                    AccountId=a.Id));
    }
    if (oppList.size() > 0) {
        insert oppList;
    }
}
```
